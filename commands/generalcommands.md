# General Command Syntax

Instead of spending time on figuring out what arguments to use in a command each time you use it, you can look at your terminal history for what you previously used.

However, with many different commands and terminals this can become quite difficult and time consuming.

Below you can find all available commands. Either select one from the ToC list or use Ctrl+F to look for it. Below the ToC there is a list of separate cheat sheets for some more complex commands.

In the commands you will find variables enclosed by `<variable>`. This simply means it needs to be replaced by your own value (e.g., `<ip>` becomes `10.10.101.81`).

## Separate command sheets

Some tools are so vast, they have many commands. Too many to include in this document whilst keeping it nice and organized. That is why I created a separate document specifically for such programs.
