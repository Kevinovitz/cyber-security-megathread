# Tools & Programs

<s>Ofcourse I can do all this stuff manually through the CLI, but sometimes I might want to have some stuff run automatically..</s>

I order to not loose site of the plethora of tools that are available, I wanted to collect some of my favorites.

<p align="center"><img alt="No judgin my meme usage plz" src="https://github.com/Kevinovitz/cyber-security-megathread/blob/main/images/Cyber_Meme_11.png" width="250" /></p>

So I created this collection of tools and programs that I find to be very usefull and might help others out in the process. I think I said it before, but I learned most of my stuff looking at what other people are doing/using.
