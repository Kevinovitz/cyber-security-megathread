# Cyber Security Megathread

This megathread aims to be my one-stop tools for everything related to cyber security. This is a heavily in-progress work and I will be updating it along the way when new things cross my path.

So far this thread can be split up into three major components:

1. **Tools and Programs**
   - Like Sublist3r or CyberChef
2. **Websites and other resources**
   - Like GTFObins or Exploit Notes
4. **Command syntax**
   - For use with the likes of Hydra or Mimikatz
