# Cyber Security Megathread

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/Kevinovitz/cyber-security-megathread/blob/main/images/Cyber_Meme_23.png" alt="Cyber Meme 23" width="50%" /></p>

This megathread aims to be my one-stop tools for everything related to cyber security. Hopefully this can make some sense of all the tools that are available out there and spare some work along the way. This is a heavily in-progress work and I will be updating it along the way when new things cross my path.

So far this thread can be split up into three major components:

1. **Tools and Programs**
   - Like Sublist3r or CyberChef
2. **Websites and other resources**
   - Like GTFObins or Exploit Notes
4. [**Command syntax**](commands/generalcommands.md)
   - For use with the likes of Hydra or Mimikatz
