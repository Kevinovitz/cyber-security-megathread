# Websites & Other Resources

Not all tools have to be downloaded or installed on your computer. I found some invaluable resources/websites the can help you in your endeavours. But, as with the commands, at a certain point it just becomes too much to remember.

So I created this collection of websites that I find to be very interesting and might help others out in the process. I mean, I learned most of my stuff looking at what other people are doing/using.
